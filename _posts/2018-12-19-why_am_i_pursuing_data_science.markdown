This decision took a long time to reach. I'm currently employed as a Social Worker for NYC working with a number of organizations to help with our lower income population. You always hear about the government keeping the poor, poor but it's jarring when you see it in action. I came to this job fresh-faced and ready to save the world, but after 3.5 years of serving my community I realize I'm effectively enabling poorly designed Social Policy. 
Most of our currenty policy is a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The whole point of the act is that people who receive public assistance should eventually transition into being able to support themselves. We, the government, are meant to provide tools to help individuals secure gainful employment and eventually reach a stage where they will no longer require our assistance. The thing is, the system is set up in a way that it makes it very hard to hold on to a job or get to your classes, while making all of your mandatory appointments to keep your benefits. Furthermore, job training programs are a laughing matter and really help nobody. I realized that my dreams to save the world could never be achieved on this route.

Then I discovered data science. Let's be real, I could definitely use the money, but even more I can actually work to effect change in Social Policy. I can show policy makers that the laws are simply not working and why with raw evidence. I'm learning data science not to completely change my career but to improve it. It's been a fantastic journey so far, can't wait to see where I am a year from now.
