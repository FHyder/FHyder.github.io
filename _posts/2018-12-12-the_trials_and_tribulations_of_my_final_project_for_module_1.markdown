We finally finishe up Module 1 a few weeks ago and boy! Was that a journey. I would say the biggest lesson I learned from these last two months and through my project is what an iterative process data science truly can be. When we were first assigned the project I looked through the data set and initially thought coming across findings wouldn't be so difficult. To be honest, ultimately it wasn't difficult, but it is very tedious. There are so many approaches to each and every aspect leading up to building your model that it can get hard to decide which route to take. I think figuring out what predictors I would be using proved to be my biggest challenge. If I'm honest I worked backwards. I first worked with predictors that I thought would just be easier to work with, and logically made sense as strong predictors for our target. However, it felt too easy and I realized that saying "I just didn't like how those predictors look" wouldn't be a good enough explanation for management in a working environment. I then had to use different strategies to rid myself of different variables. Filtering through multicollinearity between variables, linearity within variables, low value counts for variable entries, high p-value and other methods narrowed my dataset down to a handful of predictors to work with. However, when I built my final model I realized that some variables that I had previously dropped due to mlticollinearity deserved some further inspection. This led me to build a whole new SECOND model, if you can believe it. Sure enough, the results of my second model proved fruitful and has been included in my keynote. I'm very nervous about presenting this project to my lead next week but I feel better about how I will approach project 2 at the end of the next Module.
